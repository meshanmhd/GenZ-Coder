### Project Description
GenZ Coder is basically your Gen Z coding BFF that gets your vibe ‚Äî it speaks fluent sus, no cap, and big yikes while you type your code. It runs your scripts right in the browser so you can flex your skills without leaving TikTok. Perfect for hacking away while staying lowkey, making coding less cringe and more drip.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever tried coding while simultaneously juggling TikTok trends, memes, and slang? Normal coding tools just don‚Äôt get you. They speak in boring, ancient computer talk, leaving you feeling mad disconnected. Plus, switching between your code editor and the ‚ÄòGen Z dictionary‚Äô is a total vibe kill.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
GenZ Coder solves this unheard-of struggle by being the only coding environment that actually understands Gen Z slang ‚Äî so your code and your language are always on fleek. Because, honestly, who needs traditional compilers when you can code with big brain Gen Z energy?
